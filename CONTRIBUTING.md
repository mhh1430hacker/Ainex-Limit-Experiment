# Contributing Guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the AINEX Law project! This file is a root-level copy of `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` so GitHub will show a dedicated "Contributing" tab for visitors. The full, canonical guide also remains in `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` for maintainers.

## Add Visual Assets (Images)

To include images that appear inline on this page or others, add image files to the `images/` folder at the repository root and reference them like:

```markdown
![Alt text](images/your-image.png)
```

Place high-resolution images (PNG or JPG). Example filenames:
- `images/hero.png`
- `images/architecture.png`

## Quick Contribution Steps

1. Fork the repository and create a branch:

```bash
git clone <your-fork-url>
cd Ainex-Limit-Experiment
git checkout -b feature/your-feature
```

2. Make changes and run tests (or run notebook cells).
3. Commit with clear message and push:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat(docs): improve contributing guide"
git push origin feature/your-feature
```

4. Open a Pull Request and reference related issues.

## Notes

- This root-level `CONTRIBUTING.md` exists so GitHub will display a separate tab for contributors and visitors.
- Maintain the canonical, detailed content in `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` and keep the root file in sync as needed.

Thank you for helping improve this project!
